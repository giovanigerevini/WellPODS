# WellPODS â€“ Offshore Production Well Dynamic Simulator

**WellPODS** is a modular dynamic simulator for offshore production wells, integrating simplified physical models and data-driven methods.  
It enables fast, scalable, and reliable simulations for flow assurance, production optimization, and control applications.

This repository is part of the development of the doctoral thesis in the Graduate Program in Chemical Engineering at COPPE/UFRJ.
